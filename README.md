# Pytter

A simple Python module to obtain tweets from users at
[twitter](https://twitter.com) without having to have
twitter developer's account. This is achieved by using 
twitter's own v1.1 API and leveraging the guest token,
thus making the client appears as if they are simply
a user who does not log in. This would benefit us for
simple tweets scraping for individual users; however
because of the rate limit it would not work for large-scale
data scraping.

Currently under heavy development. If you have any
questions, don't hesitate to raise them as Issues.
